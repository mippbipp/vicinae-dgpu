# Agents

Per-app dGPU wrapper entries for NixOS, shipped as a Vicinae extension (`apps/extension`) and a CLI (`apps/cli`) over one shared domain package (`packages/core`).

## Learning more about Effect

This repository uses the Effect Typescript library.

Before writing any Effect code, first read `node_modules/effect/AGENTS.md`
**completely**, and follow the links in the file when required.

If you need to learn more about particular Effect apis and concepts that the
guide doesn't cover, search through the source code in `node_modules/effect/src`.

## Packaging constraints

- `apps/extension/package.json` is the Vicinae manifest. Its `name` (`dgpu`) is the installed extension directory, and the Nix derivation name must match it. Keep the package CommonJS (no `"type": "module"`): `vici build` emits a CJS bundle.
- `vici build` typechecks the extension, including the `packages/core` sources it imports, with its bundled TypeScript 5.9. Code in both must compile there as well as under the workspace TypeScript.
- Any `pnpm-lock.yaml` change needs a new `pnpmDeps` hash in `nix/package.nix`. Set it to `""`, run `nix build .#cli`, and copy the `got:` hash.

## Agent skills

Always use @unslop skill.

### Issue tracker

Issues live in GitHub Issues (`mippbipp/vicinae-dgpu`, via `gh`). See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Default five-label vocabulary, each label string equal to its role name. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: root `GLOSSARY.md` + `docs/adr/`. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

## What you need from me

- End every turn where you're blocked on me, or where the next step needs me, with a short "**What I need from you**" section. Numbered, one concrete action per item: exactly what to do, where (which site, app, file or person), and what to send back. e.g. "Log into CommBank NetBank and export Jan to Jun 2026 as CSV, then drop it in `inbox/`", not "I need the bank data".
- If there are several, put the quickest or most blocking one first, and say what you'll get on with in the meantime.
- If you don't need anything from me, say "Nothing needed from you right now" so I don't have to ask.
- Never bury a request for me in the middle of a long update.

# This is NOT the Turborepo you know

Turborepo configuration, task behavior, and CLI commands can vary between installed versions and may differ from your training data. Resolve the `turbo` package from this file's directory or relevant workspace; in monorepos, it may not be visible from the repository root. For example, run `node -p "require.resolve('turbo/package.json')"` from a workspace that depends on `turbo`.

Read `docs/README.md` inside that installed package first, then read the relevant pages from its `docs/` directory before changing Turborepo configuration or commands. Heed deprecation notices. These bundled docs match the installed package version and are available without network access.

This block is written and re-added by `turbo` before repository-scoped commands when an AI agent is detected. In the Turborepo source repository, its template is defined in `crates/turborepo-cli/src/cli/agent_guidance.rs`. Removing the managed block while updates are enabled means a later qualifying invocation will add it again. Set `"agentGuidance": false` in the root `turbo.json` or `turbo.jsonc` to opt out; this does not remove an existing block. Keep the block committed with your work to avoid an uncommitted change on the next agent invocation.
